## SQL Pruning Utility

A simple utility written in .NET to to prune MS-SQL backup files from a given folder (or an Amazon S3 bucket).

The program lists all Microsoft SQL Server `.bak` files in a given folder or Amazon S3 bucket and determines which one to keep or prune.

#### Disclaimer

**WARNING**: This program is designed to delete files. The authors of this program do not accept liability for any errors or data-loss which could arise as a result of it.

#### Pruning Rules

1. Keep one week of daily backups
2. One Sunday of backups for a four weeks
3. One backup per month for a year
4. One backup per year after that
6. When more than one backup per day, keep the most recent.
5. Prune anything else

**Notes:** 

The following pruning rules apply:

- **per database**
- only support the _Julian_ calendar 
- apply from the _date of the most recent backup_ for a given database

Example of expected file names (as automatically generated by backup plans created in Microsoft SQL Management Studio):

    dbname1_backup_2014_06_20_010002_0897411.bak
    dbname2_backup_2014_06_20_010002_0957417.bak
    ...

The utility relies on the date *in the file name*, **not** the file system's creation date.

#### Usage:

    sqlprune.exe [path] [-verbose] [-delete] [-no-confirm] [-aws-profile]

 * __path__ is the path to a local folder or an S3 bucket containting .bak files (e.g. `c:\sql-backups` or `s3://bucket-name/backups`)
 * __-verbose__ writes more information to the standard output
 * __-delete__ is a flag you must add otherwise files will not be deleted
 * __-no-confim__ is flag you can if you don't want to confirm before any file is deleted
 * __-aws-profile__ is optional and defaults to the value to the `AWSProfileName` app setting (see S3 Credentials)

#### Download & Install:

1. Find the [latest release](https://github.com/comsechq/sql-prune/releases).
2. Extract the zip in a folder.
3. Run the command from the command line prompt.

#### S3 Credentials

You can ignore this completely if you just want to prune files from a local folder.

sqlprune.exe loads the amazon credentials it needs to connect to S3 a
[configuration file](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) located in `~/.aws/config`, using the `default` profile.

Example:

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    aws_secret_access_key = YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

You can have more than one profile in your configuration file.

To override the default profile name, either modify the `AWSProfileName` setting  in `sqlprune.exe.config` or alternatively add an `-aws-profile` parameter when you execute `sqlprune.exe` from the command line.

You can also modify the `AWSProfilesLocation` setting in `sqlprune.exe.config` to load a different file (e.g. "c:\aws\config").

#### TODO:

- Output size of each file and give a summary of how much data is used and how much is going to be deleted.
- Cutomisable pruning rules: 
    - Load the rules from an XML configuration file
    - Generate an XSD that describes the XML syntax for pruning rules 
    - The pruning rules in the configuration file are applied one after the other

#### Unit Testing

Veryfying which date should be kept or pruned is a tedious task.

To make it easier, we have modified an [SVG visualiser](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318) 
to render the output of the unit tests into familiar calendar view.

After you run the unit tests in `PruneServiceTest`, open `Calendar.html` in a modern web browser.

_If your web browser doesn't have access to you local file system (e.g. Chrome) it will refuse to load the .json file._
